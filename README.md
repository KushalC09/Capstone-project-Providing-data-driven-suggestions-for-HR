# Capstone-project-Providing-data-driven-suggestions-for-HR
Employee Retention Analysis and Prediction model.

Description and deliverables:

This capstone project is an opportunity for you to analyze a dataset and build predictive models that can provide insights to the Human Resources (HR) department of a large consulting firm.

Upon completion, you will have two artifacts that you would be able to present to future employers. One is a brief one-page summary of this project that you would present to external stakeholders as the data professional in Salifort Motors. The other is a complete code notebook provided here. Please consider your prior course work and select one way to achieve this given project question. Either use a regression model or machine learning model to predict whether or not an employee will leave the company. The exemplar following this actiivty shows both approaches, but you only need to do one.

In your deliverables, you will include the model evaluation (and interpretation if applicable), a data visualization(s) of your choice that is directly related to the question you ask, ethical considerations, and the resources you used to troubleshoot and find answers or solutions.



Conclusion, Recommendations:


The models and the feature importances extracted from the models confirm that employees at the company are overworked. 

To retain employees, the following recommendations could be presented to the stakeholders:

* Cap the number of projects that employees can work on.
* Consider promoting employees who have been with the company for atleast four years, or conduct further investigation about why four-year tenured employees are so dissatisfied. 
* Either reward employees for working longer hours, or don't require them to do so. 
* If employees aren't familiar with the company's overtime pay policies, inform them about this. If the expectations around workload and time off aren't explicit, make them clear. 
* Hold company-wide and within-team discussions to understand and address the company work culture, across the board and in specific contexts. 
* High evaluation scores should not be reserved for employees who work 200+ hours per month. Consider a proportionate scale for rewarding employees who contribute more/put in more effort.
